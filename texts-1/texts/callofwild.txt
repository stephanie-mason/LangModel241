<s> and as he had seen horses work so he was set to work hauling francois on a sled to the forest that fringed the valley and returning with a load of firewood </s>

<s> the first day they covered thirty-five miles to the big salmon the next day thirty-five more to the little salmon the third day forty miles which brought them well up toward the five fingers buck's feet were not so compact and hard as the feet of the huskies his had softened during the many generations since the day his last wild ancestor was tamed by a cave-dweller or river man </s>
<s> all day long he limped in agony and camp once made lay down like a dead dog </s>

<s> also the dog-driver rubbed buck's feet for half an hour each night after supper and sacrificed the tops of his own moccasins to make four moccasins for buck </s>
<s> this was a great relief and buck caused even the weazened face of perrault to twist itself into a grin one morning when francois forgot the moccasins and buck lay on his back his four feet waving appealingly in the air and refused to budge without them </s>
<s> later his feet grew hard to the trail and the worn-out foot-gear was thrown away at the pelly one morning as they were harnessing up dolly who had never been conspicuous for anything went suddenly mad </s>

<s> he had never seen a dog go mad nor did he have any reason to fear madness yet he knew that here was horror and fled away from it in a panic </s>
<s> straight away he raced with dolly panting and frothing one leap behind nor could she gain on him so great was his terror nor could he leave her so great was her madness </s>
<s> he plunged through the wooded breast of the island flew down to the lower end crossed a back channel filled with rough ice to another island gained a third island curved back to the main river and in desperation started to cross it </s>
<s> and all the time though he did not look he could hear her snarling just one leap behind </s>
<s> francois called to him a quarter of a mile away and he doubled back still one leap ahead gasping painfully for air and putting all his faith in that francois would save him </s>
<s> the dog-driver held the axe poised in his hand and as buck shot past him the axe crashed down upon mad dolly's head buck staggered over against the sled exhausted sobbing for breath helpless </s>
<s> this was spitz's opportunity </s>
<s> he sprang upon buck and twice his teeth sank into his unresisting foe and ripped and tore the flesh to the bone </s>
<s> then francois's lash descended and buck had the satisfaction of watching spitz receive the worst whipping as yet administered to any of the teams one devil dat spitz remarked perrault some dam day heem keel dat buck dat buck two devils was francois's rejoinder all de tam i watch dat buck i know for sure </s>

<s> spitz as lead-dog and acknowledged master of the team felt his supremacy threatened by this strange southland dog </s>

<s> they were all too soft dying under the toil the frost and starvation </s>
<s> buck was the exception </s>
<s> he alone endured and prospered matching the husky in strength savagery and cunning </s>
<s> then he was a masterful dog and what made him dangerous was the fact that the club of the man in the red sweater had knocked all blind pluck and rashness out of his desire for mastery </s>
<s> he was preeminently cunning and could bide his time with a patience that was nothing less than primitive it was inevitable that the clash for leadership should come </s>
<s> buck wanted it </s>
<s> he wanted it because it was his nature because he had been gripped tight by that nameless incomprehensible pride of the trail and trace -- that pride which holds dogs in the toil to the last gasp which lures them to die joyfully in the harness and breaks their hearts if they are cut out of the harness </s>
<s> this was the pride of dave as wheel-dog of sol-leks as he pulled with all his strength the pride that laid hold of them at break of camp transforming them from sour and sullen brutes into straining eager ambitious creatures the pride that spurred them on all day and dropped them at pitch of camp at night letting them fall back into gloomy unrest and uncontent </s>
<s> this was the pride that bore up spitz and made him thrash the sled-dogs who blundered and shirked in the traces or hid away at harness-up time in the morning likewise it was this pride that made him fear buck as a possible lead-dog </s>
<s> and this was buck's pride too he openly threatened the other's leadership </s>
<s> he came between him and the shirks he should have punished </s>
<s> and he did it deliberately </s>
<s> one night there was a heavy snowfall and in the morning pike the malingerer did not appear </s>
<s> he was securely hidden in his nest under a foot of snow francois called him and sought him in vain </s>
<s> spitz was wild with wrath he raged through the camp smelling and digging in every likely place snarling so frightfully that pike heard and shivered in his hiding-place but when he was at last unearthed and spitz flew at him to punish him buck flew with equal rage in between </s>

<s> pike who had been trembling abjectly took heart at this open mutiny and sprang upon his overthrown leader </s>
<s> buck to whom fair play was a forgotten code likewise sprang upon spitz </s>
<s> but francois chuckling at the incident while unswerving in the administration of justice brought his lash down upon buck with all his might </s>
<s> this failed to drive buck from his prostrate rival and the butt of the whip was brought into play </s>
<s> half-stunned by the blow buck was knocked backward and the lash laid upon him again and again while spitz soundly punished the many times offending pike in the days that followed as dawson grew closer and closer buck still continued to interfere between spitz and the culprits but he did it craftily when francois was not around with the covert mutiny of buck a general insubordination sprang up and increased </s>
<s> dave and sol-leks were unaffected but the rest of the team went from bad to worse things no longer went right </s>
<s> there was continual bickering and jangling trouble was always afoot and at the bottom of it was buck </s>
<s> he kept francois busy for the dog-driver was in constant apprehension of the life-and-death struggle between the two which he knew must take place sooner or later and on more than one night the sounds of quarrelling and strife among the other dogs turned him out of his sleeping robe fearful that buck and spitz were at it but the opportunity did not present itself and they pulled into dawson one dreary afternoon with the great fight still to come </s>
<s> here were many men and countless dogs and buck found them all at work </s>
<s> it seemed the ordained order of things that dogs should work </s>
<s> all day they swung up and down the main street in long teams and in the night their jingling bells still went by </s>
<s> they hauled cabin logs and firewood freighted up to the mines and did all manner of work that horses did in the santa clara valley </s>
<s> here and there buck met southland dogs but in the main they were the wild wolf husky breed </s>
<s> every night regularly at nine at twelve at three they lifted a nocturnal song a weird and eerie chant in which it was buck's delight to join with the aurora borealis flaming coldly overhead or the stars leaping in the frost dance and the land numb and frozen under its pall of snow this song of the huskies might have been the defiance of life only it was pitched in minor key with long-drawn wailings and half-sobs and was more the pleading of life the articulate travail of existence </s>
<s> it was an old song old as the breed itself -- one of the first songs of the younger world in a day when songs were sad </s>
<s> it was invested with the woe of unnumbered generations this plaint by which buck was so strangely stirred </s>
<s> when he moaned and sobbed it was with the pain of living that was of old the pain of his wild fathers and the fear and mystery of the cold and dark that was to them fear and mystery </s>
<s> and that he should be stirred by it marked the completeness with which he harked back through the ages of fire and roof to the raw beginnings of life in the howling ages seven days from the time they pulled into dawson they dropped down the steep bank by the barracks to the yukon trail and pulled for dyea and salt water </s>
<s> perrault was carrying despatches if anything more urgent than those he had brought in also the travel pride had gripped him and he purposed to make the record trip of the year </s>

<s> the insidious revolt led by buck had destroyed the solidarity of the team </s>
<s> it no longer was as one dog leaping in the traces </s>

<s> no more was spitz a leader greatly to be feared </s>
<s> the old awe departed and they grew equal to challenging his authority </s>
<s> pike robbed him of half a fish one night and gulped it down under the protection of buck </s>
<s> another night dub and joe fought spitz and made him forego the punishment they deserved </s>
<s> and even billee the good-natured was less good-natured and whined not half so placatingly as in former days </s>
<s> buck never came near spitz without snarling and bristling menacingly </s>
<s> in fact his conduct approached that of a bully and he was given to swaggering up and down before spitz's very nose the breaking down of discipline likewise affected the dogs in their relations with one another </s>
<s> they quarrelled and bickered more than ever among themselves till at times the camp was a howling bedlam </s>
<s> dave and sol-leks alone were unaltered though they were made irritable by the unending squabbling </s>
<s> francois swore strange barbarous oaths and stamped the snow in futile rage and tore his hair </s>
<s> his lash was always singing among the dogs but it was of small avail </s>
<s> directly his back was turned they were at it again </s>

<s> francois knew he was behind all the trouble and buck knew he knew but buck was too clever ever again to be caught red-handed </s>
<s> he worked faithfully in the harness for the toil had become a delight to him yet it was a greater delight slyly to precipitate a fight amongst his mates and tangle the traces at the mouth of the tahkeena one night after supper dub turned up a snowshoe rabbit blundered it and missed </s>
<s> in a second the whole team was in full cry </s>
<s> a hundred yards away was a camp of the northwest police with fifty dogs huskies all who joined the chase </s>

<s> he was sounding the deeps of his nature and of the parts of his nature that were deeper than he going back into the womb of time he was mastered by the sheer surging of life the tidal wave of being the perfect joy of each separate muscle joint and sinew in that it was everything that was not death that it was aglow and rampant expressing itself in movement flying exultantly under the stars and over the face of dead matter that did not move but spitz cold and calculating even in his supreme moods left the pack and cut across a narrow neck of land where the creek made a long bend around </s>
<s> buck did not know of this and as he rounded the bend the frost wraith of a rabbit still flitting before him he saw another and larger frost wraith leap from the overhanging bank into the immediate path of the rabbit </s>

<s> over the whiteness and silence brooded a ghostly calm there was not the faintest whisper of air -- nothing moved not a leaf quivered the visible breaths of the dogs rising slowly and lingering in the frosty air </s>
<s> they had made short work of the snowshoe rabbit these dogs that were ill-tamed wolves and they were now drawn up in an expectant circle </s>

<s> fang clashed fang and lips were cut and bleeding but buck could not penetrate his enemy's guard </s>
<s> then he warmed up and enveloped spitz in a whirlwind of rushes </s>
<s> time and time again he tried for the snow-white throat where life bubbled near to the surface and each time and every time spitz slashed him and got away </s>
<s> then buck took to rushing as though for the throat when suddenly drawing back his head and curving in from the side he would drive his shoulder at the shoulder of spitz as a ram by which to overthrow him </s>
<s> but instead buck's shoulder was slashed down each time as spitz leaped lightly away spitz was untouched while buck was streaming with blood and panting hard </s>
<s> the fight was growing desperate </s>
<s> and all the while the silent and wolfish circle waited to finish off whichever dog went down </s>
<s> as buck grew winded spitz took to rushing and he kept him staggering for footing </s>
<s> once buck went over and the whole circle of sixty dogs started up but he recovered himself almost in mid air and the circle sank down again and waited but buck possessed a quality that made for greatness -- imagination </s>

<s> only this time he was the one who was beaten there was no hope for him </s>
<s> buck was inexorable </s>
<s> mercy was a thing reserved for gentler climes </s>

<s> they were short of weight and in poor condition when they made dawson and should have had a ten days' or a week's rest at least </s>

<s> billee cried and whimpered regularly in his sleep each night </s>
<s> joe was sourer than ever and sol-leks was unapproachable blind side or other side but it was dave who suffered most of all </s>
<s> something had gone wrong with him </s>
<s> he became more morose and irritable and when camp was pitched at once made his nest where his driver fed him </s>

<s> the scotch half-breed called a halt and took him out of the team making the next dog sol-leks fast to the sled his intention was to rest dave letting him run free behind the sled sick as he was dave resented being taken out grunting and growling while the traces were unfastened and whimpering broken-heartedly when he saw sol-leks in the position he had held and served so long </s>
<s> for the pride of trace and trail was his and sick unto death he could not bear that another dog should do his work when the sled started he floundered in the soft snow alongside the beaten trail attacking sol-leks with his teeth rushing against him and trying to thrust him off into the soft snow on the other side striving to leap inside his traces and get between him and the sled and all the while whining and yelping and crying with grief and pain </s>
<s> the half-breed tried to drive him away with the whip but he paid no heed to the stinging lash and the man had not the heart to strike harder </s>
<s> dave refused to run quietly on the trail behind the sled where the going was easy but continued to flounder alongside in the soft snow where the going was most difficult till exhausted </s>
<s> then he fell and lay where he fell howling lugubriously as the long train of sleds churned by with the last remnant of his strength he managed to stagger along behind till the train made another stop when he floundered past the sleds to his own where he stood alongside sol-leks </s>
<s> his driver lingered a moment to get a light for his pipe from the man behind </s>
<s> then he returned and started his dogs </s>
<s> they swung out on the trail with remarkable lack of exertion turned their heads uneasily and stopped in surprise </s>
<s> the driver was surprised too the sled had not moved </s>
<s> he called his comrades to witness the sight </s>
<s> dave had bitten through both of sol-leks's traces and was standing directly in front of the sled in his proper place he pleaded with his eyes to remain there </s>
<s> the driver was perplexed </s>
<s> his comrades talked of how a dog could break its heart through being denied the work that killed it and recalled instances they had known where dogs too old for the toil or injured had died because they were cut out of the traces </s>
<s> also they held it a mercy since dave was to die anyway that he should die in the traces heart-easy and content </s>
<s> so he was harnessed in again and proudly he pulled as of old though more than once he cried out involuntarily from the bite of his inward hurt several times he fell down and was dragged in the traces and once the sled ran upon him so that he limped thereafter in one of his hind legs but he held out till camp was reached when his driver made a place for him by the fire </s>
<s> morning found him too weak to travel </s>
<s> at harness-up time he tried to crawl to his driver </s>
<s> by convulsive efforts he got on his feet staggered and fell </s>
<s> then he wormed his way forward slowly toward where the harnesses were being put on his mates </s>
<s> he would advance his fore legs and drag up his body with a sort of hitching movement when he would advance his fore legs and hitch ahead again for a few more inches </s>
<s> his strength left him and the last his mates saw of him he lay gasping in the snow and yearning toward them </s>
<s> but they could hear him mournfully howling till they passed out of sight behind a belt of river timber here the train was halted </s>

<s> every muscle every fibre every cell was tired dead tired </s>
<s> and there was reason for it </s>

<s> den we get one long res' </s>
<s> eh for sure </s>
<s> one bully long res' the drivers confidently expected a long stopover </s>
<s> themselves they had covered twelve hundred miles with two days' rest and in the nature of reason and common justice they deserved an interval of loafing </s>
<s> but so many were the men who had rushed into the klondike and so many were the sweethearts wives and kin that had not rushed in that the congested mail was taking on alpine proportions also there were official orders fresh batches of hudson bay dogs were to take the places of those worthless for the trail </s>
<s> the worthless ones were to be got rid of and since dogs count for little against dollars they were to be sold three days passed by which time buck and his mates found how really tired and weak they were </s>
<s> then on the morning of the fourth day two men from the states came along and bought them harness and all for a song </s>
<s> the men addressed each other as hal and charles charles was a middle-aged lightish-colored man with weak and watery eyes and a mustache that twisted fiercely and vigorously up giving the lie to the limply drooping lip it concealed </s>
<s> hal was a youngster of nineteen or twenty with a big colt's revolver and a hunting-knife strapped about him on a belt that fairly bristled with cartridges </s>
<s> this belt was the most salient thing about him </s>

<s> both men were manifestly out of place and why such as they should adventure the north is part of the mystery of things that passes understanding buck heard the chaffering saw the money pass between the man and the government agent and knew that the scotch half-breed and the mail-train drivers were passing out of his life on the heels of perrault and francois and the others who had gone before </s>
<s> when driven with his mates to the new owners' camp buck saw a slipshod and slovenly affair tent half stretched dishes unwashed everything in disorder also he saw a woman mercedes the men called her </s>
<s> she was charles's wife and hal's sister -- a nice family party buck watched them apprehensively as they proceeded to take down the tent and load the sled </s>
<s> there was a great deal of effort about their manner but no businesslike method </s>
<s> the tent was rolled into an awkward bundle three times as large as it should have been </s>
<s> the tin dishes were packed away unwashed </s>
<s> mercedes continually fluttered in the way of her men and kept up an unbroken chattering of remonstrance and advice </s>

<s> it seemed a mite top-heavy charles turned his back and drew the lashings down as well as he could which was not in the least well an' of course the dogs can hike along all day with that contraption behind them affirmed a second of the men certainly said hal with freezing politeness taking hold of the gee-pole with one hand and swinging his whip from the other mush! he shouted mush on there! the dogs sprang against the breast-bands strained hard for a few moments then relaxed </s>

<s> throw away that tent and all those dishes -- who's going to wash them anyway good lord do you think you're travelling on a pullman and so it went the inexorable elimination of the superfluous </s>
<s> mercedes cried when her clothes-bags were dumped on the ground and article after article was thrown out </s>

<s> charles and hal went out in the evening and bought six outside dogs </s>
<s> these added to the six of the original team and teek and koona the huskies obtained at the rink rapids on the record trip brought the team up to fourteen </s>
<s> but the outside dogs though practically broken in since their landing did not amount to much </s>

<s> they did not seem to know anything these newcomers </s>
<s> buck and his comrades looked upon them with disgust and though he speedily taught them their places and what not to do he could not teach them what to do </s>
<s> they did not take kindly to trace and trail </s>
<s> with the exception of the two mongrels they were bewildered and spirit-broken by the strange savage environment in which they found themselves and by the ill treatment they had received </s>
<s> the two mongrels were without spirit at all bones were the only things breakable about them with the newcomers hopeless and forlorn and the old team worn out by twenty-five hundred miles of continuous trail the outlook was anything but bright </s>
<s> the two men however were quite cheerful </s>
<s> and they were proud too </s>
<s> they were doing the thing in style with fourteen dogs </s>
<s> they had seen other sleds depart over the pass for dawson or come in from dawson but never had they seen a sled with so many as fourteen dogs </s>
<s> in the nature of arctic travel there was a reason why fourteen dogs should not drag one sled and that was that one sled could not carry the food for fourteen dogs </s>
<s> but charles and hal did not know this </s>
<s> they had worked the trip out with a pencil so much to a dog so many dogs so many days qed </s>
<s> mercedes looked over their shoulders and nodded comprehensively it was all so very simple late next morning buck led the long team up the street </s>
<s> there was nothing lively about it no snap or go in him and his fellows </s>
<s> they were starting dead weary </s>
<s> four times he had covered the distance between salt water and dawson and the knowledge that jaded and tired he was facing the same trail once more made him bitter </s>
<s> his heart was not in the work nor was the heart of any dog </s>
<s> the outsides were timid and frightened the insides without confidence in their masters buck felt vaguely that there was no depending upon these two men and the woman </s>
<s> they did not know how to do anything and as the days went by it became apparent that they could not learn </s>
<s> they were slack in all things without order or discipline </s>
<s> it took them half the night to pitch a slovenly camp and half the morning to break that camp and get the sled loaded in fashion so slovenly that for the rest of the day they were occupied in stopping and rearranging the load </s>
<s> some days they did not make ten miles </s>
<s> on other days they were unable to get started at all </s>
<s> and on no day did they succeed in making more than half the distance used by the men as a basis in their dog-food computation it was inevitable that they should go short on dog-food </s>
<s> but they hastened it by overfeeding bringing the day nearer when underfeeding would commence </s>
<s> the outside dogs whose digestions had not been trained by chronic famine to make the most of little had voracious appetites and when in addition to this the worn-out huskies pulled weakly hal decided that the orthodox ration was too small </s>
<s> he doubled it </s>
<s> and to cap it all when mercedes with tears in her pretty eyes and a quaver in her throat could not cajole him into giving the dogs still more she stole from the fish-sacks and fed them slyly </s>
<s> but it was not food that buck and the huskies needed but rest </s>
<s> and though they were making poor time the heavy load they dragged sapped their strength severely then came the underfeeding </s>
<s> hal awoke one day to the fact that his dog-food was half gone and the distance only quarter covered further that for love or money no additional dog-food was to be obtained </s>
<s> so he cut down even the orthodox ration and tried to increase the day's travel </s>
<s> his sister and brother-in-law seconded him but they were frustrated by their heavy outfit and their own incompetence </s>
<s> it was a simple matter to give the dogs less food but it was impossible to make the dogs travel faster while their own inability to get under way earlier in the morning prevented them from travelling longer hours </s>
<s> not only did they not know how to work dogs but they did not know how to work themselves the first to go was dub </s>
<s> poor blundering thief that he was always getting caught and punished he had none the less been a faithful worker </s>
<s> his wrenched shoulder-blade untreated and unrested went from bad to worse till finally hal shot him with the big colt's revolver </s>
<s> it is a saying of the country that an outside dog starves to death on the ration of the husky so the six outside dogs under buck could do no less than die on half the ration of the husky </s>
<s> the newfoundland went first followed by the three short-haired pointers the two mongrels hanging more grittily on to life but going in the end by this time all the amenities and gentlenesses of the southland had fallen away from the three people </s>
<s> shorn of its glamour and romance arctic travel became to them a reality too harsh for their manhood and womanhood </s>
<s> mercedes ceased weeping over the dogs being too occupied with weeping over herself and with quarrelling with her husband and brother </s>
<s> to quarrel was the one thing they were never too weary to do their irritability arose out of their misery increased with it doubled upon it outdistanced it </s>
<s> the wonderful patience of the trail which comes to men who toil hard and suffer sore and remain sweet of speech and kindly did not come to these two men and the woman </s>
<s> they had no inkling of such a patience </s>
<s> they were stiff and in pain their muscles ached their bones ached their very hearts ached and because of this they became sharp of speech and hard words were first on their lips in the morning and last at night charles and hal wrangled whenever mercedes gave them a chance </s>
<s> it was the cherished belief of each that he did more than his share of the work and neither forbore to speak this belief at every opportunity sometimes mercedes sided with her husband sometimes with her brother the result was a beautiful and unending family quarrel </s>
<s> starting from a dispute as to which should chop a few sticks for the fire ( a dispute which concerned only charles and hal ) presently would be lugged in the rest of the family fathers mothers uncles cousins people thousands of miles away and some of them dead </s>
<s> that hal's views on art or the sort of society plays his mother's brother wrote should have anything to do with the chopping of a few sticks of firewood passes comprehension nevertheless the quarrel was as likely to tend in that direction as in the direction of charles's political prejudices </s>
<s> and that charles's sister's tale-bearing tongue should be relevant to the building of a yukon fire was apparent only to mercedes who disburdened herself of copious opinions upon that topic and incidentally upon a few other traits unpleasantly peculiar to her husband's family </s>
<s> in the meantime the fire remained unbuilt the camp half pitched and the dogs unfed mercedes nursed a special grievance -- the grievance of sex </s>
<s> she was pretty and soft and had been chivalrously treated all her days </s>
<s> but the present treatment by her husband and brother was everything save chivalrous </s>
<s> it was her custom to be helpless </s>
<s> they complained </s>
<s> upon which impeachment of what to her was her most essential sex-prerogative she made their lives unendurable </s>
<s> she no longer considered the dogs and because she was sore and tired she persisted in riding on the sled </s>
<s> she was pretty and soft but she weighed one hundred and twenty pounds -- a lusty last straw to the load dragged by the weak and starving animals she rode for days till they fell in the traces and the sled stood still </s>
<s> charles and hal begged her to get off and walk pleaded with her entreated the while she wept and importuned heaven with a recital of their brutality on one occasion they took her off the sled by main strength </s>
<s> they never did it again </s>
<s> she let her legs go limp like a spoiled child and sat down on the trail </s>
<s> they went on their way but she did not move </s>
<s> after they had travelled three miles they unloaded the sled came back for her and by main strength put her on the sled again in the excess of their own misery they were callous to the suffering of their animals </s>
<s> hal's theory which he practised on others was that one must get hardened </s>
<s> he had started out preaching it to his sister and brother-in-law </s>
<s> failing there he hammered it into the dogs with a club at the five fingers the dog-food gave out and a toothless old squaw offered to trade them a few pounds of frozen horse-hide for the colt's revolver that kept the big hunting-knife company at hal's hip </s>

<s> for that matter they were all loafing -- buck john thornton and skeet and nig -- waiting for the raft to come that was to carry them down to dawson </s>
<s> skeet was a little irish setter who early made friends with buck who in a dying condition was unable to resent her first advances </s>
<s> she had the doctor trait which some dogs possess and as a mother cat washes her kittens so she washed and cleansed buck's wounds </s>
<s> regularly each morning after he had finished his breakfast she performed her self-appointed task till he came to look for her ministrations as much as he did for thornton's </s>
<s> nig equally friendly though less demonstrative was a huge black dog half bloodhound and half deerhound with eyes that laughed and a boundless good nature to buck's surprise these dogs manifested no jealousy toward him </s>
<s> they seemed to share the kindliness and largeness of john thornton </s>
<s> as buck grew stronger they enticed him into all sorts of ridiculous games in which thornton himself could not forbear to join and in this fashion buck romped through his convalescence and into a new existence </s>
<s> love genuine passionate love was his for the first time </s>
<s> this he had never experienced at judge miller's down in the sun-kissed santa clara valley with the judge's sons hunting and tramping it had been a working partnership with the judge's grandsons a sort of pompous guardianship and with the judge himself a stately and dignified friendship </s>

<s> other men saw to the welfare of their dogs from a sense of duty and business expediency he saw to the welfare of his as if they were his own children because he could not help it </s>
<s> and he saw further </s>
<s> he never forgot a kindly greeting or a cheering word and to sit down for a long talk with them ( gas he called it ) was as much his delight as theirs </s>
<s> he had a way of taking buck's head roughly between his hands and resting his own head upon buck's of shaking him back and forth the while calling him ill names that to buck were love names </s>
<s> buck knew no greater joy than that rough embrace and the sound of murmured oaths and at each jerk back and forth it seemed that his heart would be shaken out of his body so great was its ecstasy </s>
<s> and when released he sprang to his feet his mouth laughing his eyes eloquent his throat vibrant with unuttered sound and in that fashion remained without movement john thornton would reverently exclaim god! you can all but speak! buck had a trick of love expression that was akin to hurt </s>
<s> he would often seize thornton's hand in his mouth and close so fiercely that the flesh bore the impress of his teeth for some time afterward </s>
<s> and as buck understood the oaths to be love words so the man understood this feigned bite for a caress for the most part however buck's love was expressed in adoration while he went wild with happiness when thornton touched him or spoke to him he did not seek these tokens </s>
<s> unlike skeet who was wont to shove her nose under thornton's hand and nudge and nudge till petted or nig who would stalk up and rest his great head on thornton's knee buck was content to adore at a distance </s>
<s> he would lie by the hour eager alert at thornton's feet looking up into his face dwelling upon it studying it following with keenest interest each fleeting expression every movement or change of feature </s>
<s> or as chance might have it he would lie farther away to the side or rear watching the outlines of the man and the occasional movements of his body </s>
<s> and often such was the communion in which they lived the strength of buck's gaze would draw john thornton's head around and he would return the gaze without speech his heart shining out of his eyes as buck's heart shone out for a long time after his rescue buck did not like thornton to get out of his sight </s>
<s> from the moment he left the tent to when he entered it again buck would follow at his heels </s>
<s> his transient masters since he had come into the northland had bred in him a fear that no master could be permanent </s>
<s> he was afraid that thornton would pass out of his life as perrault and francois and the scotch half-breed had passed out </s>
<s> even in the night in his dreams he was haunted by this fear </s>
<s> at such times he would shake off sleep and creep through the chill to the flap of the tent where he would stand and listen to the sound of his master's breathing but in spite of this great love he bore john thornton which seemed to bespeak the soft civilizing influence the strain of the primitive which the northland had aroused in him remained alive and active faithfulness and devotion things born of fire and roof were his yet he retained his wildness and wiliness </s>
<s> he was a thing of the wild come in from the wild to sit by john thornton's fire rather than a dog of the soft southland stamped with the marks of generations of civilization </s>
<s> because of his very great love he could not steal from this man but from any other man in any other camp he did not hesitate an instant while the cunning with which he stole enabled him to escape detection his face and body were scored by the teeth of many dogs and he fought as fiercely as ever and more shrewdly </s>
<s> skeet and nig were too good-natured for quarrelling -- besides they belonged to john thornton but the strange dog no matter what the breed or valor swiftly acknowledged buck's supremacy or found himself struggling for life with a terrible antagonist </s>
<s> and buck was merciless </s>
<s> he had learned well the law of club and fang and he never forewent an advantage or drew back from a foe he had started on the way to death </s>
<s> he had lessoned from spitz and from the chief fighting dogs of the police and mail and knew there was no middle course </s>
<s> he must master or be mastered while to show mercy was a weakness </s>
<s> mercy did not exist in the primordial life </s>
<s> it was misunderstood for fear and such misunderstandings made for death </s>
<s> kill or be killed eat or be eaten was the law and this mandate down out of the depths of time he obeyed he was older than the days he had seen and the breaths he had drawn </s>

<s> he sat by john thornton's fire a broad-breasted dog white-fanged and long-furred but behind him were the shades of all manner of dogs half-wolves and wild wolves urgent and prompting tasting the savor of the meat he ate thirsting for the water he drank scenting the wind with him listening with him and telling him the sounds made by the wild life in the forest dictating his moods directing his actions lying down to sleep with him when he lay down and dreaming with him and beyond him and becoming themselves the stuff of his dreams so peremptorily did these shades beckon him that each day mankind and the claims of mankind slipped farther from him </s>
<s> deep in the forest a call was sounding and as often as he heard this call mysteriously thrilling and luring he felt compelled to turn his back upon the fire and the beaten earth around it and to plunge into the forest and on and on he knew not where or why nor did he wonder where or why the call sounding imperiously deep in the forest </s>
<s> but as often as he gained the soft unbroken earth and the green shade the love for john thornton drew him back to the fire again thornton alone held him </s>
<s> the rest of mankind was as nothing </s>
<s> chance travellers might praise or pet him but he was cold under it all and from a too demonstrative man he would get up and walk away </s>

<s> burton struck out without warning straight from the shoulder </s>
<s> thornton was sent spinning and saved himself from falling only by clutching the rail of the bar those who were looking on heard what was neither bark nor yelp but a something which is best described as a roar and they saw buck's body rise up in the air as he left the floor for burton's throat </s>

<s> hans paid out the rope permitting no slack while pete kept it clear of coils </s>
<s> buck held on till he was on a line straight above thornton then he turned and with the speed of an express train headed down upon him </s>

<s> from the beginning there had been an ancient and ramshackle cabin </s>
<s> dying men had sworn to it and to the mine the site of which it marked clinching their testimony with nuggets that were unlike any known grade of gold in the northland but no living man had looted this treasure house and the dead were dead wherefore john thornton and pete and hans with buck and half a dozen other dogs faced into the east on an unknown trail to achieve where men and dogs as good as themselves had failed </s>
<s> they sledded seventy miles up the yukon swung to the left into the stewart river passed the mayo and the mcquestion and held on until the stewart itself became a streamlet threading the upstanding peaks which marked the backbone of the continent john thornton asked little of man or nature </s>
<s> he was unafraid of the wild </s>
<s> with a handful of salt and a rifle he could plunge into the wilderness and fare wherever he pleased and as long as he pleased </s>
<s> being in no haste indian fashion he hunted his dinner in the course of the day's travel and if he failed to find it like the indian he kept on travelling secure in the knowledge that sooner or later he would come to it </s>
<s> so on this great journey into the east straight meat was the bill of fare ammunition and tools principally made up the load on the sled and the time-card was drawn upon the limitless future to buck it was boundless delight this hunting fishing and indefinite wandering through strange places </s>
<s> for weeks at a time they would hold on steadily day after day and for weeks upon end they would camp here and there the dogs loafing and the men burning holes through frozen muck and gravel and washing countless pans of dirt by the heat of the fire </s>
<s> sometimes they went hungry sometimes they feasted riotously all according to the abundance of game and the fortune of hunting </s>
<s> summer arrived and dogs and men packed on their backs rafted across blue mountain lakes and descended or ascended unknown rivers in slender boats whipsawed from the standing forest the months came and went and back and forth they twisted through the uncharted vastness where no men were and yet where men had been if the lost cabin were true </s>
<s> they went across divides in summer blizzards shivered under the midnight sun on naked mountains between the timber line and the eternal snows dropped into summer valleys amid swarming gnats and flies and in the shadows of glaciers picked strawberries and flowers as ripe and fair as any the southland could boast </s>
<s> in the fall of the year they penetrated a weird lake country sad and silent where wildfowl had been but where then there was no life nor sign of life -- only the blowing of chill winds the forming of ice in sheltered places and the melancholy rippling of waves on lonely beaches and through another winter they wandered on the obliterated trails of men who had gone before </s>
<s> once they came upon a path blazed through the forest an ancient path and the lost cabin seemed very near </s>
<s> but the path began nowhere and ended nowhere and it remained mystery as the man who made it and the reason he made it remained mystery </s>
<s> another time they chanced upon the time-graven wreckage of a hunting lodge and amid the shreds of rotted blankets john thornton found a long-barrelled flint-lock </s>

<s> it caused him to feel a vague sweet gladness and he was aware of wild yearnings and stirrings for he knew not what sometimes he pursued the call into the forest looking for it as though it were a tangible thing barking softly or defiantly as the mood might dictate </s>
<s> he would thrust his nose into the cool wood moss or into the black soil where long grasses grew and snort with joy at the fat earth smells or he would crouch for hours as if in concealment behind fungus-covered trunks of fallen trees wide-eyed and wide-eared to all that moved and sounded about him </s>
<s> it might be lying thus that he hoped to surprise this call he could not understand </s>
<s> but he did not know why he did these various things </s>

<s> he would be lying in camp dozing lazily in the heat of the day when suddenly his head would lift and his ears cock up intent and listening and he would spring to his feet and dash away and on and on for hours through the forest aisles and across the open spaces where the niggerheads bunched </s>
<s> he loved to run down dry watercourses and to creep and spy upon the bird life in the woods </s>
<s> for a day at a time he would lie in the underbrush where he could watch the partridges drumming and strutting up and down </s>
<s> but especially he loved to run in the dim twilight of the summer midnights listening to the subdued and sleepy murmurs of the forest reading signs and sounds as man may read a book and seeking for the mysterious something that called -- called waking or sleeping at all times for him to come one night he sprang from sleep with a start eager-eyed nostrils quivering and scenting his mane bristling in recurrent waves </s>
<s> from the forest came the call ( or one note of it for the call was many noted ) distinct and definite as never before -- a long-drawn howl like yet unlike any noise made by husky dog </s>
<s> and he knew it in the old familiar way as a sound heard before </s>
<s> he sprang through the sleeping camp and in swift silence dashed through the woods </s>
<s> as he drew closer to the cry he went more slowly with caution in every movement till he came to an open place among the trees and looking out saw erect on haunches with nose pointed to the sky a long lean timber wolf he had made no noise yet it ceased from its howling and tried to sense his presence </s>
<s> buck stalked into the open half crouching body gathered compactly together tail straight and stiff feet falling with unwonted care </s>
<s> every movement advertised commingled threatening and overture of friendliness </s>
<s> it was the menacing truce that marks the meeting of wild beasts that prey </s>
<s> but the wolf fled at sight of him </s>
<s> he followed with wild leapings in a frenzy to overtake </s>
<s> he ran him into a blind channel in the bed of the creek where a timber jam barred the way </s>
<s> the wolf whirled about pivoting on his hind legs after the fashion of joe and of all cornered husky dogs snarling and bristling clipping his teeth together in a continuous and rapid succession of snaps buck did not attack but circled him about and hedged him in with friendly advances </s>
<s> the wolf was suspicious and afraid for buck made three of him in weight while his head barely reached buck's shoulder watching his chance he darted away and the chase was resumed </s>
<s> time and again he was cornered and the thing repeated though he was in poor condition or buck could not so easily have overtaken him </s>
<s> he would run till buck's head was even with his flank when he would whirl around at bay only to dash away again at the first opportunity but in the end buck's pertinacity was rewarded for the wolf finding that no harm was intended finally sniffed noses with him </s>

<s> after some time of this the wolf started off at an easy lope in a manner that plainly showed he was going somewhere </s>
<s> he made it clear to buck that he was to come and they ran side by side through the sombre twilight straight up the creek bed into the gorge from which it issued and across the bleak divide where it took its rise on the opposite slope of the watershed they came down into a level country where were great stretches of forest and many streams and through these great stretches they ran steadily hour after hour the sun rising higher and the day growing warmer </s>
<s> buck was wildly glad </s>

<s> old memories were coming upon him fast and he was stirring to them as of old he stirred to the realities of which they were the shadows </s>
<s> he had done this thing before somewhere in that other and dimly remembered world and he was doing it again now running free in the open the unpacked earth underfoot the wide sky overhead they stopped by a running stream to drink and stopping buck remembered john thornton </s>

<s> but buck turned about and started slowly on the back track </s>
<s> for the better part of an hour the wild brother ran by his side whining softly </s>
<s> then he sat down pointed his nose upward and howled </s>
<s> it was a mournful howl and as buck held steadily on his way he heard it grow faint and fainter until it was lost in the distance john thornton was eating dinner when buck dashed into camp and sprang upon him in a frenzy of affection overturning him scrambling upon him licking his face biting his hand -- playing the general tom-fool as john thornton characterized it the while he shook buck back and forth and cursed him lovingly for two days and nights buck never left camp never let thornton out of his sight </s>
<s> he followed him about at his work watched him while he ate saw him into his blankets at night and out of them in the morning </s>
<s> but after two days the call in the forest began to sound more imperiously than ever </s>
<s> buck's restlessness came back on him and he was haunted by recollections of the wild brother and of the smiling land beyond the divide and the run side by side through the wide forest stretches </s>
<s> once again he took to wandering in the woods but the wild brother came no more and though he listened through long vigils the mournful howl was never raised he began to sleep out at night staying away from camp for days at a time and once he crossed the divide at the head of the creek and went down into the land of timber and streams </s>
<s> there he wandered for a week seeking vainly for fresh sign of the wild brother killing his meat as he travelled and travelling with the long easy lope that seems never to tire </s>
<s> he fished for salmon in a broad stream that emptied somewhere into the sea and by this stream he killed a large black bear blinded by the mosquitoes while likewise fishing and raging through the forest helpless and terrible </s>
<s> even so it was a hard fight and it aroused the last latent remnants of buck's ferocity </s>
<s> and two days later when he returned to his kill and found a dozen wolverenes quarrelling over the spoil he scattered them like chaff and those that fled left two behind who would quarrel no more the blood-longing became stronger than ever before </s>
<s> he was a killer a thing that preyed living on the things that lived unaided alone by virtue of his own strength and prowess surviving triumphantly in a hostile environment where only the strong survived </s>
<s> because of all this he became possessed of a great pride in himself which communicated itself like a contagion to his physical being </s>
<s> it advertised itself in all his movements was apparent in the play of every muscle spoke plainly as speech in the way he carried himself and made his glorious furry coat if anything more glorious </s>
<s> but for the stray brown on his muzzle and above his eyes and for the splash of white hair that ran midmost down his chest he might well have been mistaken for a gigantic wolf larger than the largest of the breed </s>
<s> from his st </s>

<s> bernard intelligence and all this plus an experience gained in the fiercest of schools made him as formidable a creature as any that roamed the wild </s>
<s> a carnivorous animal living on a straight meat diet he was in full flower at the high tide of his life overspilling with vigor and virility </s>
<s> when thornton passed a caressing hand along his back a snapping and crackling followed the hand each hair discharging its pent magnetism at the contact </s>
<s> every part brain and body nerve tissue and fibre was keyed to the most exquisite pitch and between all the parts there was a perfect equilibrium or adjustment </s>
<s> to sights and sounds and events which required action he responded with lightning-like rapidity </s>
<s> quickly as a husky dog could leap to defend from attack or to attack he could leap twice as quickly </s>
<s> he saw the movement or heard sound and responded in less time than another dog required to compass the mere seeing or hearing </s>
<s> he perceived and determined and responded in the same instant in point of fact the three actions of perceiving determining and responding were sequential but so infinitesimal were the intervals of time between them that they appeared simultaneous </s>
<s> his muscles were surcharged with vitality and snapped into play sharply like steel springs </s>
<s> life streamed through him in splendid flood glad and rampant until it seemed that it would burst him asunder in sheer ecstasy and pour forth generously over the world never was there such a dog said john thornton one day as the partners watched buck marching out of camp when he was made the mould was broke said pete py jingo! i t'ink so mineself hans affirmed they saw him marching out of camp but they did not see the instant and terrible transformation which took place as soon as he was within the secrecy of the forest </s>
<s> he no longer marched </s>
<s> at once he became a thing of the wild stealing along softly cat-footed a passing shadow that appeared and disappeared among the shadows </s>
<s> he knew how to take advantage of every cover to crawl on his belly like a snake and like a snake to leap and strike </s>
<s> he could take a ptarmigan from its nest kill a rabbit as it slept and snap in mid air the little chipmunks fleeing a second too late for the trees </s>
<s> fish in open pools were not too quick for him nor were beaver mending their dams too wary </s>
<s> he killed to eat not from wantonness but he preferred to eat what he killed himself </s>
<s> so a lurking humor ran through his deeds and it was his delight to steal upon the squirrels and when he all but had them to let them go chattering in mortal fear to the treetops as the fall of the year came on the moose appeared in greater abundance moving slowly down to meet the winter in the lower and less rigorous valleys </s>
<s> buck had already dragged down a stray part-grown calf but he wished strongly for larger and more formidable quarry and he came upon it one day on the divide at the head of the creek </s>
<s> a band of twenty moose had crossed over from the land of streams and timber and chief among them was a great bull </s>
<s> he was in a savage temper and standing over six feet from the ground was as formidable an antagonist as even buck could desire </s>
<s> back and forth the bull tossed his great palmated antlers branching to fourteen points and embracing seven feet within the tips </s>
<s> his small eyes burned with a vicious and bitter light while he roared with fury at sight of buck from the bull's side just forward of the flank protruded a feathered arrow-end which accounted for his savageness </s>
<s> guided by that instinct which came from the old hunting days of the primordial world buck proceeded to cut the bull out from the herd </s>
<s> it was no slight task </s>
<s> he would bark and dance about in front of the bull just out of reach of the great antlers and of the terrible splay hoofs which could have stamped his life out with a single blow </s>
<s> unable to turn his back on the fanged danger and go on the bull would be driven into paroxysms of rage </s>
<s> at such moments he charged buck who retreated craftily luring him on by a simulated inability to escape </s>
<s> but when he was thus separated from his fellows two or three of the younger bulls would charge back upon buck and enable the wounded bull to rejoin the herd there is a patience of the wild -- dogged tireless persistent as life itself -- that holds motionless for endless hours the spider in its web the snake in its coils the panther in its ambuscade this patience belongs peculiarly to life when it hunts its living food and it belonged to buck as he clung to the flank of the herd retarding its march irritating the young bulls worrying the cows with their half-grown calves and driving the wounded bull mad with helpless rage for half a day this continued </s>
<s> buck multiplied himself attacking from all sides enveloping the herd in a whirlwind of menace cutting out his victim as fast as it could rejoin its mates wearing out the patience of creatures preyed upon which is a lesser patience than that of creatures preying as the day wore along and the sun dropped to its bed in the northwest ( the darkness had come back and the fall nights were six hours long ) the young bulls retraced their steps more and more reluctantly to the aid of their beset leader </s>
<s> the down-coming winter was harrying them on to the lower levels and it seemed they could never shake off this tireless creature that held them back </s>
<s> besides it was not the life of the herd or of the young bulls that was threatened </s>
<s> the life of only one member was demanded which was a remoter interest than their lives and in the end they were content to pay the toll as twilight fell the old bull stood with lowered head watching his mates -- the cows he had known the calves he had fathered the bulls he had mastered -- as they shambled on at a rapid pace through the fading light </s>
<s> he could not follow for before his nose leaped the merciless fanged terror that would not let him go </s>
<s> three hundredweight more than half a ton he weighed he had lived a long strong life full of fight and struggle and at the end he faced death at the teeth of a creature whose head did not reach beyond his great knuckled knees from then on night and day buck never left his prey never gave it a moment's rest never permitted it to browse the leaves of trees or the shoots of young birch and willow </s>
<s> nor did he give the wounded bull opportunity to slake his burning thirst in the slender trickling streams they crossed </s>
<s> often in desperation he burst into long stretches of flight </s>
<s> at such times buck did not attempt to stay him but loped easily at his heels satisfied with the way the game was played lying down when the moose stood still attacking him fiercely when he strove to eat or drink the great head drooped more and more under its tree of horns and the shambling trot grew weak and weaker </s>
<s> he took to standing for long periods with nose to the ground and dejected ears dropped limply and buck found more time in which to get water for himself and in which to rest </s>
<s> at such moments panting with red lolling tongue and with eyes fixed upon the big bull it appeared to buck that a change was coming over the face of things </s>
<s> he could feel a new stir in the land </s>
<s> as the moose were coming into the land other kinds of life were coming in forest and stream and air seemed palpitant with their presence </s>
<s> the news of it was borne in upon him not by sight or sound or smell but by some other and subtler sense </s>
<s> he heard nothing saw nothing yet knew that the land was somehow different that through it strange things were afoot and ranging and he resolved to investigate after he had finished the business in hand at last at the end of the fourth day he pulled the great moose down for a day and a night he remained by the kill eating and sleeping turn and turn about </s>
<s> then rested refreshed and strong he turned his face toward camp and john thornton </s>
<s> he broke into the long easy lope and went on hour after hour never at loss for the tangled way heading straight home through strange country with a certitude of direction that put man and his magnetic needle to shame as he held on he became more and more conscious of the new stir in the land </s>
<s> there was life abroad in it different from the life which had been there throughout the summer </s>
<s> no longer was this fact borne in upon him in some subtle mysterious way </s>
<s> the birds talked of it the squirrels chattered about it the very breeze whispered of it </s>
<s> several times he stopped and drew in the fresh morning air in great sniffs reading a message which made him leap on with greater speed </s>
<s> he was oppressed with a sense of calamity happening if it were not calamity already happened and as he crossed the last watershed and dropped down into the valley toward camp he proceeded with greater caution three miles away he came upon a fresh trail that sent his neck hair rippling and bristling it led straight toward camp and john thornton buck hurried on swiftly and stealthily every nerve straining and tense alert to the multitudinous details which told a story -- all but the end </s>
<s> his nose gave him a varying description of the passage of the life on the heels of which he was travelling </s>
<s> he remarked the pregnant silence of the forest </s>
<s> the bird life had flitted </s>
<s> the squirrels were in hiding </s>
<s> one only he saw -- a sleek gray fellow flattened against a gray dead limb so that he seemed a part of it a woody excrescence upon the wood itself as buck slid along with the obscureness of a gliding shadow his nose was jerked suddenly to the side as though a positive force had gripped and pulled it </s>
<s> he followed the new scent into a thicket and found nig he was lying on his side dead where he had dragged himself an arrow protruding head and feathers from either side of his body a hundred yards farther on buck came upon one of the sled-dogs thornton had bought in dawson </s>
<s> this dog was thrashing about in a death-struggle directly on the trail and buck passed around him without stopping </s>
<s> from the camp came the faint sound of many voices rising and falling in a sing-song chant </s>
<s> bellying forward to the edge of the clearing he found hans lying on his face feathered with arrows like a porcupine </s>
<s> at the same instant buck peered out where the spruce-bough lodge had been and saw what made his hair leap straight up on his neck and shoulders a gust of overpowering rage swept over him </s>
<s> he did not know that he growled but he growled aloud with a terrible ferocity </s>
<s> for the last time in his life he allowed passion to usurp cunning and reason and it was because of his great love for john thornton that he lost his head the yeehats were dancing about the wreckage of the spruce-bough lodge when they heard a fearful roaring and saw rushing upon them an animal the like of which they had never seen before </s>
<s> it was buck a live hurricane of fury hurling himself upon them in a frenzy to destroy </s>
<s> he sprang at the foremost man ( it was the chief of the yeehats ) ripping the throat wide open till the rent jugular spouted a fountain of blood he did not pause to worry the victim but ripped in passing with the next bound tearing wide the throat of a second man </s>
<s> there was no withstanding him </s>
<s> he plunged about in their very midst tearing rending destroying in constant and terrific motion which defied the arrows they discharged at him </s>
<s> in fact so inconceivably rapid were his movements and so closely were the indians tangled together that they shot one another with the arrows and one young hunter hurling a spear at buck in mid air drove it through the chest of another hunter with such force that the point broke through the skin of the back and stood out beyond </s>
<s> then a panic seized the yeehats and they fled in terror to the woods proclaiming as they fled the advent of the evil spirit and truly buck was the fiend incarnate raging at their heels and dragging them down like deer as they raced through the trees </s>
<s> it was a fateful day for the yeehats </s>
<s> they scattered far and wide over the country and it was not till a week later that the last of the survivors gathered together in a lower valley and counted their losses </s>
<s> as for buck wearying of the pursuit he returned to the desolated camp </s>
<s> he found pete where he had been killed in his blankets in the first moment of surprise </s>
<s> thornton's desperate struggle was fresh-written on the earth and buck scented every detail of it down to the edge of a deep pool </s>

<s> the pool itself muddy and discolored from the sluice boxes effectually hid what it contained and it contained john thornton for buck followed his trace into the water from which no trace led away all day buck brooded by the pool or roamed restlessly about the camp death as a cessation of movement as a passing out and away from the lives of the living he knew and he knew john thornton was dead </s>
<s> it left a great void in him somewhat akin to hunger but a void which ached and ached and which food could not fill at times when he paused to contemplate the carcasses of the yeehats he forgot the pain of it and at such times he was aware of a great pride in himself -- a pride greater than any he had yet experienced </s>
<s> he had killed man the noblest game of all and he had killed in the face of the law of club and fang he sniffed the bodies curiously </s>

<s> it was harder to kill a husky dog than them </s>
<s> they were no match at all were it not for their arrows and spears and clubs </s>
<s> thenceforward he would be unafraid of them except when they bore in their hands their arrows spears and clubs night came on and a full moon rose high over the trees into the sky lighting the land till it lay bathed in ghostly day </s>
<s> and with the coming of the night brooding and mourning by the pool buck became alive to a stirring of the new life in the forest other than that which the yeehats had made he stood up listening and scenting </s>
<s> from far away drifted a faint sharp yelp followed by a chorus of similar sharp yelps </s>
<s> as the moments passed the yelps grew closer and louder </s>
<s> again buck knew them as things heard in that other world which persisted in his memory </s>
<s> he walked to the centre of the open space and listened </s>
<s> it was the call the many-noted call sounding more luringly and compellingly than ever before </s>
<s> and as never before he was ready to obey </s>
<s> john thornton was dead </s>
<s> the last tie was broken </s>
<s> man and the claims of man no longer bound him hunting their living meat as the yeehats were hunting it on the flanks of the migrating moose the wolf pack had at last crossed over from the land of streams and timber and invaded buck's valley </s>
<s> into the clearing where the moonlight streamed they poured in a silvery flood and in the centre of the clearing stood buck motionless as a statue waiting their coming </s>
<s> they were awed so still and large he stood and a moment's pause fell till the boldest one leaped straight for him </s>
<s> like a flash buck struck breaking the neck </s>
<s> then he stood without movement as before the stricken wolf rolling in agony behind him </s>
<s> three others tried it in sharp succession and one after the other they drew back streaming blood from slashed throats or shoulders this was sufficient to fling the whole pack forward pell-mell crowded together blocked and confused by its eagerness to pull down the prey </s>
<s> buck's marvellous quickness and agility stood him in good stead pivoting on his hind legs and snapping and gashing he was everywhere at once presenting a front which was apparently unbroken so swiftly did he whirl and guard from side to side </s>
<s> but to prevent them from getting behind him he was forced back down past the pool and into the creek bed till he brought up against a high gravel bank </s>
<s> he worked along to a right angle in the bank which the men had made in the course of mining and in this angle he came to bay protected on three sides and with nothing to do but face the front and so well did he face it that at the end of half an hour the wolves drew back discomfited </s>
<s> the tongues of all were out and lolling the white fangs showing cruelly white in the moonlight </s>
<s> some were lying down with heads raised and ears pricked forward others stood on their feet watching him and still others were lapping water from the pool </s>
<s> one wolf long and lean and gray advanced cautiously in a friendly manner and buck recognized the wild brother with whom he had run for a night and a day </s>
<s> he was whining softly and as buck whined they touched noses then an old wolf gaunt and battle-scarred came forward </s>
<s> buck writhed his lips into the preliminary of a snarl but sniffed noses with him whereupon the old wolf sat down pointed nose at the moon and broke out the long wolf howl </s>
<s> the others sat down and howled </s>
<s> and now the call came to buck in unmistakable accents </s>
<s> he too sat down and howled </s>
<s> this over he came out of his angle and the pack crowded around him sniffing in half-friendly half-savage manner </s>
<s> the leaders lifted the yelp of the pack and sprang away into the woods </s>
<s> the wolves swung in behind yelping in chorus </s>
<s> and buck ran with them side by side with the wild brother yelping as he ran * * * * * and here may well end the story of buck </s>
<s> the years were not many when the yeehats noted a change in the breed of timber wolves for some were seen with splashes of brown on head and muzzle and with a rift of white centring down the chest </s>

<s> they are afraid of this ghost dog for it has cunning greater than they stealing from their camps in fierce winters robbing their traps slaying their dogs and defying their bravest hunters nay the tale grows worse </s>
<s> hunters there are who fail to return to the camp and hunters there have been whom their tribesmen found with throats slashed cruelly open and with wolf prints about them in the snow greater than the prints of any wolf </s>
<s> each fall when the yeehats follow the movement of the moose there is a certain valley which they never enter </s>

<s> here a yellow stream flows from rotted moose-hide sacks and sinks into the ground with long grasses growing through it and vegetable mould overrunning it and hiding its yellow from the sun and here he muses for a time howling once long and mournfully ere he departs but he is not always alone </s>
<s> when the long winter nights come on and the wolves follow their meat into the lower valleys he may be seen running at the head of the pack through the pale moonlight or glimmering borealis leaping gigantic above his fellows his great throat a-bellow as he sings a song of the younger world which is the song of the pack </s>
